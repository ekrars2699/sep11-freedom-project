* I looked at a couple of the tools on the list and I thought phaser would fit me best.
* I looked at [https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-phaser-launcher](https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-phaser-launcher). With that tutorial I learned how to set up phaser in my IDE.
* I also looked at various games and other projects made using phaser on the phaser website in order to see if I wanted to use phaser for my project.
* I also used [https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1) in order to see what making a game in phaser would be like.
* Using these tutorials I learned how phaser has a library of different assets full of images and other various things that many people use to make their own games.
